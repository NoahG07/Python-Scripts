Collection of Python Scripts 
___
- yifyV2.py  
Webscraper - Allows subtitle files to be searched, downloaded then extracted. Only works for [YIFY Subtitles](yifysubtitles.com).
- base64-decrypter[VER.2].py  
Simple Base64 password decryptor. 
- my_ip.py  
Collects the local IP and uses the [ipify API](ipify.org) to collect public IP address. 
- network_test.py  
Small script to test network connectivity every 3 minutes.
- notes.py  
My horrible attempt at recreating a note/text app in the terminal.
- pip-upgrade-V2.py  
Simple GUI application that updates pip. Currently only works on Windows OS.
- ZipCracker.py  
Small script to crack password protected zip files.
- keylogger.py  
Simple keylogger that can create local logs or email them to you. It is the creation of following this [Python Code Tutorial: How to Make a Keylogger in Python](https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/write-a-keylogger-python). I added my own code for the creation of a secret directory that stores the logs in Windows or Linux systems (hopefully works on Macs aswell). I also created a function that pops open an error window to 'trick' the user whose machine it runs on. (Hint: If you change it to a '.pyw' file, no terminals will pop up).
